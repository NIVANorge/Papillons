| :------- | :----------- |
|1. Click on <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #5cb85c">New upload</span> |![](Images/upload-btn.png)
2.

5. Your upload will be searchable on Zenodo, but not yet connected to the Papillons community. A curator (community owner) will receive your request to include your file in the community repository and approve it if the community requirements are fulfilled (if any). The rules for <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #f0ad4e">Embargoed Access</span>, <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #d9534f">Restricted Access</span>, and <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #d9534f">Closed Access</span> also apply for curators. That means that they can only access open access files.|![](Images/uploadCurator.png)|
