## About

_These are instructions for the test environment_ 

[Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org/) is an open-source repository for scientific outputs. Zenodo enables linking research outputs to datasets and funding information. All uploads get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), and all data are stored at the European Organization for Nuclear Research  [(CERN)](https://www.home.cern/).

This brief how-to will describe how to search for and upload data to Zenodo via its test environment. This environment is an exact copy of Zenodo, but here you will have the ability to test the tool before uploading data to the actual Papillons community (coming soon).
