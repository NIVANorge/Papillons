## About

_These are instructions for the test environment_ 

[Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org/) is an open-source repository for scientific outputs. Zenodo enables linking research outputs to datasets and funding information. All uploads get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), and all data are stored at the European Organization for Nuclear Research  [(CERN)](https://www.home.cern/).

This brief how-to will describe how to search for and upload data to Zenodo via its test environment. This environment is an exact copy of Zenodo, but here you will have the ability to test the tool before uploading data to the actual Papillons community (coming soon).

**Description of tags:**

- Uploaded date: <span class="label label-info ng-scope ng-binding" style="background-color:#6aa3d5">Month,DD,YYY(version)
- Type of file: <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #777">Dataset; Presentation; Poster, etc</span> 
- Type of access:
    - <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #5cb85c">Open Access</span> 
    - <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #f0ad4e">Embargoed Access</span> - The file will be given open access after a date specified by the person who uploaded de file (this person can also edit the date. More later) 
    - <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #d9534f">Restricted Access</span> - Access can be requested. Conditions for access can be given by the publisher.

## Uploading files



| | |
| :------- | :----------- |
|1. Click on <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #5cb85c">New upload</span> |![](Images/upload-btn.png)
2. Upload the file by either drag and drop or by clicking on the <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #357ebd">Choose files</span>, followed by <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #5cb85c">Start upload</span>|![](Images/Upload_tagged.png)|
3. Some fields are required such as upload and license type, and basic information. It is also possible to add additional information such as contributors, alternative identifiers, references, funding, journal, etc.| ![](Images/Upload_information.png)|
|4. When you click on <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #357ebd">Publish</span>, you will receive a warning recommending to use Zenodo Sandbox if you wish to just test upload, even when you are already in the sandbox. Just click on <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #357ebd">I understand</span>. A DOI number will be automatically created.| ![](Images/warning.png)|
|5. Your upload will be searchable on Zenodo, but not yet connected to the community Papillons (Test Papillons in this case). A curator will receive your upload request and accept or decline it. The rules for <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #f0ad4e">Embargoed Access</span>, <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #d9534f">Restricted Access</span>, and <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #d9534f">Closed Access</span> also apply for curators. That means that they can only access open files. 
5. You can find all your uploads (including drafts) by clicking on _Upload_ On the top banner| ![](Images/your_upload.png)
